# week2-project

Reflections:

This took me a long time, missing the two days forced me to do a lot of googling!

I stupidly named the .css 'script' which kept confusing me.
I worked through FreeCodeCamp's JavaScript lessons and found the overly pedantic exercises helped me actually work out what was going on, i'll keep following their lessons alongside our ones.
I find it really hard to visulise what the code is going to do and i'm not particuarly creative so i'm not sure i'll ever be a web designer but i'm starting to enjoy coding and the problem solving that goes with it.
I love playing coding games and find them helpful and i'm also really loving using the terminal and am trying to teach myself to not reach for the mouse.
i had to give up trying to fix the dodgy looking header at the top and yes the crappy scrolling heading was deliberate!
